                <h3>Causes</h3>
                <p>Marburg virus disease is caused by infection with the Marburg virus. This virus belongs to the
                    Filoviridae family and is primarily transmitted to humans through close contact with the body fluids
                    of infected animals, such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, and gorillas. When an infected person's body
                    fluids, including blood, saliva, urine, feces, vomit, sweat, and semen, come into contact with
                    broken skin or mucous membranes of another individual, the virus can be transmitted. The Marburg
                    virus targets and damages various cells in the human body, including immune cells, liver cells, and
                    endothelial cells that line blood vessels. This can lead to the classic symptoms of Marburg virus
                    disease, including fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal
                    pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising. In severe cases, the virus can cause internal and
                    external bleeding, organ failure, and ultimately death. Importantly, person-to-person transmission
                    through close contact with infected individuals is the primary mode of Marburg virus spread in human
                    populations.</p>

                <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>The main risk factors for Marburg virus disease include: <br>Proximity to and contact with infected
                    individuals or their bodily fluids. <br>Handling or consuming infected animals, such as fruit bats,
                    chimpanzees, and gorillas. <br>Traveling to or living in areas with ongoing Marburg virus outbreaks.
                    <br>Certain occupations, such as healthcare workers, that involve close contact with infected
                    individuals or their environment. <br>Lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and
                    proper infection control measures. <br>Underlying medical conditions that weaken the immune system.

            <p class="white">The Marburg virus disease first emerged in 1967 in outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt,
                Germany, and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). The outbreaks were linked to laboratory work with
                African green monkeys imported from Uganda. The virus was named after the German city of Marburg, where
                the first cases were identified. Since its discovery, Marburg has caused periodic outbreaks in various
                parts of Africa, with the largest outbreak occurring in Angola in 2005. The Marburg virus is known to be
                transmitted through contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals or animals, and it can cause
                severe and often fatal illness in humans, similar to Ebola virus disease.
