    <h2>CAUSES</h2>
    <p>Causes From Corona Virus</p>
    <ul class="cards">
      <li class="card">
        <img src="img\download (1).jpg" alt="img">
        <h3>Causes</h3>
        <p>Dengue fever is caused by infection with any one of the four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus - DENV-1,
          DENV-2, DENV-3, or DENV-4. These viruses belong to the Flavivirus genus and are transmitted to humans
          primarily through the bites of infected female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The dengue virus
          is an arbovirus, meaning it is spread by arthropod vectors like mosquitoes. When an infected mosquito bites a
          human, the virus enters the human's bloodstream and begins replicating, leading to the development of dengue
          fever. The virus targets and infects various cells in the human body, including white blood cells, liver
          cells, and endothelial cells that line blood vessels. This can lead to the classic symptoms of dengue,
          including high fever, severe headaches, joint and muscle pain, and a characteristic skin rash. Importantly,
          infection with one dengue virus serotype does not confer lifelong immunity, and subsequent infections with
          different serotypes increase the risk of developing the more severe forms of dengue, known as dengue
          hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.

      <li class="card">
        <img src="img\Dengue.jpg" alt="img">
        <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
        <p>There are several key risk factors that can increase a person's likelihood of contracting dengue fever. The
          primary risk factor is living in or traveling to areas with high endemicity of the dengue virus, particularly
          tropical and subtropical regions where the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes that transmit the
          virus are prevalent. These mosquitoes thrive in urban and semi-urban environments and breed in stagnant water
          sources like discarded tires, buckets, and flower pots. Individuals living in crowded, unsanitary conditions
          with limited access to effective mosquito control measures are at heightened risk. Certain demographic factors
          also play a role, as dengue disproportionately affects younger age groups and people with weaker immune
          systems, such as the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions. Additionally, prior infection with
          one dengue virus serotype is a significant risk factor, as it can increase the chances of developing severe
          forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, upon subsequent infection with a different serotype.
          Factors like climate change and unplanned urbanization have also contributed to the global spread and rising
          incidence of dengue in recent decades. Understanding and mitigating these various risk factors is crucial for
          implementing effective prevention and control strategies against this mosquito-borne viral disease.</p>

        <img src="img\download.jpg" alt="img">
        <h3>Serious COVID-19 illness risk factors</h3>
        <p>The risk factors for developing severe Dengue illness that can lead to hospitalization, intensive care unit
          (ICU) admission, or even death are multifaceted and well-documented. The primary driver of severe COVID-19
          outcomes is advanced age, with the elderly, particularly those over 65 years old, facing significantly higher
          risks. Underlying medical conditions also greatly increase vulnerability, including heart disease, diabetes,
          chronic lung diseases like COPD, cancer, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and weakened immune systems.
          Individuals with these preexisting conditions often experience more serious COVID-19 symptoms that can rapidly
          progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and organ failure if left unchecked. Socioeconomic
          factors also play a role, as those with limited access to quality healthcare or living in crowded,
          disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to experience worse COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, certain lifestyle
          factors like smoking have been associated with higher risks of severe illness. The exact biological mechanisms
          driving these disparities are complex and still being researched, but the cumulative evidence clearly
          identifies these as the key risk factors for the most serious COVID-19 complications. Understanding and
          addressing these risk factors is crucial for protecting the most vulnerable populations.</p>
