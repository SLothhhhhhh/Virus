                <h3>Causes</h3>
                <p>Lassa fever is caused by the Lassa virus, which belongs to the Arenaviridae family. The virus is
                    primarily transmitted to humans through contact with the urine, feces, or blood of infected rodents,
                    particularly the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis). The virus can also be transmitted through
                    direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces and objects. In rare cases, the
                    virus can be transmitted from person to person through close contact with an infected individual or
                    their bodily fluids. The Lassa virus targets and damages various organs, including the liver,
                    spleen, and kidneys, leading to severe symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness,
                    fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising. In severe cases,
                    the virus can cause organ failure and death.</p>

                <h3>Risk Factors</h3>

                    endemic, such as parts of West Africa. <br>Exposure to and contact with infected rodents, their
                    urine, feces, or blood. <br>Handling or consuming contaminated food or water. <br>Certain
                    occupations, such as healthcare workers, that involve close contact with infected individuals or
                    their bodily fluids. <br>Lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper infection
                    control measures. <br>Underlying medical conditions that weaken the immune system. </p>

                    system <br>Pregnancy <br>Delayed access to medical care and antiviral treatment <br>Lack of access

            <h3 class="white">Lassa Fever Virus Emerged in the 1960s</h3>
            <p class="white">The Lassa fever virus was first identified in 1969 in the town of Lassa, Nigeria, where it
                caused an outbreak among hospital staff. Since then, the virus has been recognized as a significant
                public health concern in parts of West Africa, where it is endemic. The Lassa fever virus is primarily
                transmitted to humans through contact with the urine, feces, or blood of infected rodents, particularly
                the multimammate mouse. While the virus can also be transmitted from person to person through close
                contact with infected individuals or their bodily fluids, this mode of transmission is relatively rare.
                The Lassa fever virus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain,
                weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, it can lead to unexplained
                bleeding or bruising, and in some instances, it can cause organ failure and death. While efforts are
                ongoing to develop effective vaccines and treatments, early supportive care and antiviral therapy remain
                crucial in managing Lassa fever outbreaks in the affected regions of West Africa.
