                <h3>Causes</h3>
                <p>Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is caused by infection with influenza viruses that primarily
                    affect birds. These viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are typically transmitted to
                    humans through close contact with infected poultry or their bodily fluids. When an infected bird's
                    secretions or feces come into contact with a human's eyes, nose, or mouth, the virus can be
                    transmitted. The bird flu virus targets and damages the respiratory system, leading to severe
                    symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and in some cases, pneumonia and acute
                    respiratory distress. In severe cases, the virus can cause organ failure and death. Person-to-person
                    transmission of bird flu is uncommon, but it can occur in rare instances, particularly when there is
                    close and prolonged contact with an infected individual.</p>

                <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>The main risk factors for bird flu include: <br>Proximity to and contact with infected poultry, such
                    as chickens, ducks, or geese. <br>Handling or consuming undercooked infected poultry or their eggs.
                    <br>Traveling to or living in areas with ongoing bird flu outbreaks in the poultry population.
                    <br>Certain occupations, such as poultry workers, that involve close contact with infected birds or
                    their environment. <br>Lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper infection
                    control measures. <br>Underlying medical conditions that weaken the immune system.

                <p>Certain factors can increase the risk of developing severe bird flu, including: <br>Older age (60
                    years and above) <br>Underlying medical conditions like chronic respiratory diseases, heart disease,
                    or weakened immune system <br>Pregnancy <br>Delayed access to medical care and antiviral treatment
                    <br>Lack of access to supportive care like mechanical ventilation and organ support <br>Certain

            <h3 class="white">Bird Flu Virus Started in the Late 1990s</h3>
            <p class="white">The bird flu virus, also known as avian influenza, first emerged as a significant public
                health concern in the late 1990s. The first notable outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus
                occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, where it led to the culling of over 1.5 million chickens. Since then, the
                virus has been detected in various parts of the world, primarily affecting poultry populations but also
                causing sporadic cases of human infections, particularly in Asia and Africa. The bird flu virus is
                primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected poultry or their bodily fluids, and it can
                cause severe respiratory illness in humans, leading to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress in some
                cases. While the virus has not yet achieved efficient person-to-person transmission, the ongoing
                outbreaks in the poultry industry and the potential for the virus to mutate and adapt to humans remain
                significant public health concerns. </p>
