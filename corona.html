        <h3>Causes</h3>
        <p>COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also called
          SARS-CoV-2.

          The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person, even from someone who is infected but has no symptoms.
          When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, breathe, sing or talk, their breath may be infected with the COVID-19
          virus.

          The coronavirus carried by a person's breath can land directly on the face of a nearby person, after a sneeze
          or cough, for example. The droplets or particles the infected person breathes out could possibly be breathed
          in by other people if they are close together or in areas with low air flow. And a person may touch a surface
          that has respiratory droplets and then touch their face with hands that have the coronavirus on them.

        <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
        <p>The main risk factors for COVID-19 are: <br>If someone you live with has COVID-19.
          <br>If you spend time in places with poor air flow and a higher number of people when the virus is spreading.
          <br>If you spend more than 30 minutes in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. <br>Many factors affect
          your risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19. How long you are in contact, if the space has good air
          flow and your activities all affect the risk. Also, if you or others wear masks, if someone has COVID-19
          symptoms and how close you are affects your risk. Close contact includes sitting and talking next to one
          another, for example, or sharing a car or bedroom.

          It seems to be rare for people to catch the virus that causes COVID-19 from an infected surface. While the
          virus is shed in waste, called stool, COVID-19 infection from places such as a public bathroom is not common.

        <h3>Serious COVID-19 illness risk factors</h3>
        <p>Some people are at a higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness than others. This includes people age 65 and
          older as well as babies younger than 6 months. Those age groups have the highest risk of needing hospital care
          for COVID-19.

          Not every risk factor for serious COVID-19 illness is known. People of all ages who have no other medical
          issues have needed hospital care for COVID-19.

          <br>Known risk factors for serious illness include people who have not gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. Serious
          illness also is a higher risk for people who have: <br>Sickle cell disease or thalassemia. <br>
          Serious heart diseases and possibly high blood pressure. <br>
          Chronic kidney, liver or lung diseases. <br> <br> This list is not complete. Factors linked to a health issue
          may raise the risk of serious COVID-19 illness too. Examples are a medical condition where people live in a
          group home, or lack of access to medical care. Also, people with more than one health issue, or people of
          older age who also have health issues have a higher chance of severe illness.
